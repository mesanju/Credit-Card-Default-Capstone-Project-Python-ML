# Credit-Card-Default-Capstone-Project-Python-ML
This is a capstone project conducted for Data Analytics Career track, Springboard from 08/03/2020 - 09/22/2020 to analyze Banking Dataset " Credit Card Default Payment" of 
size 30,000. 
Here I am trying to explore the relationship of various categorical and non categorical features towards default paymnet (0,1). Then creat a models 
( Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier) to make prediction above 50% accuracy.

Libraries used are: Python Pandas, Numpy, Scikitlearn ( Logistic Regression, Random Forest classification and Decision Tree  Classification), Seaborn, 
Matplotlib were used to perform Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning Model Prediction. 

IDE used: Jupyter note book.
